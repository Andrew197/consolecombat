Console Combat is an implementation of a turn based (somewhat final fantasy like) battle system in the windows command console. What this game lacks in graphics it makes up for in depth and complexity. It features experience and leveling, dynamically generated enemies that will provide a challenge no matter how high your level is, and even multiplayer. 
<br><br>
It also includes a stamina system and character fatigue. Over the course of a battle, stats wear down and must be managed strategically (blocking an attack weakens your defenses, super attacks tire you and reduce your attack power, etc) <br><br>

Enter the prompted numbers to navigate the menus and attack your enemies.

<br><br><b>Disclaimer:</b> This code is getting old, and hasn't been updated in quite some time. I will fix this as soon as I get time and revist this project a bit.<br><br>

I will publish the source once I give it a bit of cleanup and better commenting to bring it up to my own standards.
